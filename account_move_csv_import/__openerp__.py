Account Move CSV Import
=======================

This module handle the import of one or several account moves supplied via a CSV or TXT file. This module currently supports:

* MeilleureGestion.com payroll CSV files,
* Quadra export files,
* LibreOffice CSV export files.

This module can easily be extended to support other CSV or TXT file formats.

There are many community modules that handle the import of account moves via CSV/TXT files. But I decided to develop this module because I wanted a module with the following design guidelines:

* code is easy to read
* code is easy to debug
* expressive error messages
* module with minimum dependancies

This module has been written by Alexis de Lattre from Akretion (alexis.delattre@akretion.com).
